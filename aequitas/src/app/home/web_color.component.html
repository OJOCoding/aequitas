        <section class="web-color-content_1">
            <p>Green is considered a good color due to its association with positive meanings such as nature, life, and well-being, as well as its proven ability to generate therapeutic and positive effects, fostering recovery and enhancing subjective well-being.</p>

            <p>palett.es provides several indicators that will help you choose a color palette that is accessible to the greatest number of users following the WAGC2.0 guidelines in the contrast and color section.</p>

                <p>One of the main tools of palett.es is the contrast matrix . It visually shows us the levels of contrast between the colors that make up the palette.

                    The lowest contrast level is 1:1 and the highest possible level is 21:1 . The higher the contrast, the less problems viewing content/texts users will have.
                    
                    Color blind safe? If we read "YES" in this position, it indicates that this color combination is safe for the main types of color blindness.
                    
                    AAA/AA tells us whether this text/background color combination has enough contrast to meet the AAA or AA accessibility level at those sizes.
                    
                    Lastly the contrast index in numerical format.</p>

                <p>This quadrant provides a simulation of how users with different types of color blindness see the current palette and what the contrast levels are for the different combinations.</p>
