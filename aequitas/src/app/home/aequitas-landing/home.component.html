                There are several studies that estimate that 1 in 4 users (25%) have some type of visual disability.
                Approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women have problems with color blindness or color perception to
                varying degrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                The W3C has several initiatives aimed at raising awareness and encouraging the consideration of these
                visually impaired users when developing any web application or service (Web Accessibility Initiative,
                WAI).

            <p>
                Font pairing in design is a complex but essential aspect of creating visual appeal and conveying brand
                identity. Good font pairing involves selecting fonts that are not too similar, yet contrast in specific
                ways. Contrast is crucial in font selection, similar to color and position in design.

            <p>
                Green is considered a good color due to its association with nature, life, and well-being, as well as
                its therapeutic and positive effects. The website palett.es provides several indicators to help choose a
                color palette that is accessible according to the WCAG 2.0 guidelines in the contrast and color section.
